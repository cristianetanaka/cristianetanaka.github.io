    <h1>HI I’m Cristiane OSHIRO TANAKA...</h1>
   <p>
    I’m an Accountant and ex- Hotelier ( Hotelier = I worked for Hotels most of my career).
   Besides my passion for numbers, which I acquired due to my accounting profession. 
   I am also passionate about people, language and cultural diversity. In my free time, I love connecting with people from diverse backgrounds and get to know their story. I also love when they invite me for dinner at their house!
   Since the age of 17, I have lived, studied and worked in 4 different countries, learned 4 different languages and met people from 100+ different nationalities. 
   I’m interested about technology and how it can connect and change people’s lives. From cultural languages, I have decided to learn computer languages. I’m currently learning 4 different programming languages ( HTML, CSS, Phyton, Java)
   My goal is to combine my accounting & customer service skills with technology.
   If you are passionate about cultural diversity, tech or if you just want to share your story or invite me over for a meal at your place.<strong>Reach out</strong> , I would love to hear from you!
   I also love cooking and I will invite you over at mine for a delicious homecooked meal.</p>
